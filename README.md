# Scripting-with-bash-Learning

This project was created as part of the CoderCo learning path, building on the Linux module and moving into Bash scripting. While it wasnâ€™t the hardest topic thanks to my university background, the tasks still became more challenging as they went on.

The main takeaway? With practice, scripting gets easier. This repo shares my scripts, notes, and solutions to help me (and others) improve step by step.
